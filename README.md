# Know my Devs - Github App

Know my devs is a Github App to keep track of who contributed to your projects and repositories.

This project is inspired by the [FastAPI People page](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people), and is an alternative to keep your data without hitting github's rate limits
